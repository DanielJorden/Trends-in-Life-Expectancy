## Trends in Healthy Life Expectancy
#### PSY6422 Project

The data for this project is about healthy life expectancy in the countries and 9 main regions of the UK from 2012-2021. I am looking at how rates of healthy life expectancy change for each region over the years, as well as how they compare to the other areas. The data provides individual infomration for males and females, although I am averaging this, looking at gender as a whole.

The dataset is available by the Office for National Statistics and was collected as part of an annual population survey and census, where healthy life expectancies are estimated using a Sullivan life table.

The data can be found at: <https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/bulletins/healthstatelifeexpectanciesuk/between2011to2013and2020to2022>
If you are downloading the dataset from this Github repository, it should download in .csv format and the code has been written to load it in this format

This project was inspired by the long-lasting effects that the COVID-19 pandemic had. Just from initial interpretation, there appears to be a reduction in healthy life expectancy for all UK coutnries and regions during the COVID years, specifically 2020-2021. This seems to be most prominent for the West Midlands and the least change in Northern Ireland.
